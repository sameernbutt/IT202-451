<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I iterated through each number in $arr using a foreach loop. Then I<br>used an if statement to determine whether or not it was odd.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>As the program iterated through each number in the array, it first made<br>sure to cast it to a float using (float) then the variable, and<br>assigning to a new variable which was used.

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 5: </em> Talk about what you learned, any issues you had, how you resolve them</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In this assignment, I learned a lot about how to write code in<br>PHP, including the proper formatting necessary, how to make and use variables, and<br>how to use loops and if-else statements. I also learned about javascript and<br>how the two languages are similar, although it was not used for this<br>assignment. For this assignment, I had to utilize concatenation to make decimal places<br>work, and I had to get comfortable with that, which I did. The<br>rounding logic also took a little bit to figure out. Overall, I was<br>able to learn the basics of PHP and Javascript and how to use<br>them. It seemed very understandable since I already knew some of the basic<br>principles, but I managed to learn the syntax and how things are written<br>in these languages.<br></p><br></td></tr>
